# Daily Planner

Bootcamp week 07: Daily planner :blue_heart:

## About

> I _need_ a routine, but I cannot adhere to the planner even if my life depends on it

_This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap and moment.js._
**Accessible, convenient, awesome**. Tested in Chrome, Opera and Firefox.

### Features:

- [x] Daily planner hour by hour
- [x] Hours options input for the planner, dynamically updated HTML based on input
- [x] UX: input tasks and save by either pressing 'enter' or clicking on a 'add' button, clear the task field with a 'delete' button
- [x] UX: Option to save/clear all fields at the same time
- [x] Save data locally: by date, time and task
- [x] Crisp like a freezing wind mobile-first responsive design
